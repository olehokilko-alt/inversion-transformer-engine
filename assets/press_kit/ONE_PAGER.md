# One-Pager

## Product Highlights
- Transformer-based deep AI with adaptive inversion regularization
- Structural change detection under noise, drift and missing data
- Near real-time: controller p99 < 10 ms; ~300 eps/worker
- Proof-first packaging: KPIs, figures, consolidated report in repo

## Differentiation
- Focus on structural change vs generic forecasting/classification
- Adaptive thresholding (Youden J/F1) and window-majority labeling
- Public proofs only; secure evaluation package for KPI validation without code

## Buyers & Outcomes
- MedTech: reduces false alarms at equal sensitivity; earlier lead-time proxy
- Industrial IoT: earlier faults vs vibration thresholds; fewer false maintenance
- Cybersecurity: detects DDoS without signatures; lower false positives
- FinTech: faster regime signaling; risk reduction with lower whipsaw

## Proof Artifacts
- KPIs: ../kpi_table.md
- Latency: ../latency_plot.png
- Scalability: ../scalability_plot.png
- Report: ../investor_report.md

## Key Buyers & Outcomes
- MedTech (ECG monitoring)
  - Outcomes: reduces false alarms at equal sensitivity; earlier lead‑time proxy for AFib‑like events; robust under motion artifacts and dropouts
- Industrial IoT (predictive maintenance)
  - Outcomes: earlier fault detection vs vibration thresholds; fewer false maintenance triggers; downtime prevention and MTBF uplift
- Cybersecurity (SOC/NDR)
  - Outcomes: detects DDoS without IP reputation or signatures; lower false positives at practical thresholds; latency stability under burst traffic
- FinTech (regime detection)
  - Outcomes: faster regime change signaling; risk reduction (lower whipsaw); volatility‑aware exposure cues without overfitting to price noise

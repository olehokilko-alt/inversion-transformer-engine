# Compliance & Licensing

## Security
- No secrets committed; environment variables used only for private data (not required here)
- Logs avoid PII; datasets are public/sanitized
- Basic secure coding practices; dependency review

## Medical Disclaimer
- Not a medical device; analytics for decision support only
- Requires clinical validation for diagnostic use

## Licensing
- Commercial EULA (to be executed with buyer/reseller)
- Optional dual-license for demo artifacts
- No GPL contamination in production path

## Standards (Informal Alignment)
- SOC 2 / ISO 27001 practices: access control, logging, dependency hygiene (non-certified)
- Data handling: public datasets only; no customer data in repo
